# _Space Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _A calculator that can take in years lived on Earth, and convert them into years lived on different planets in the solar system._ _November 13th 2020_

#### By _**Garrett Brown**_

## Description
_A calculator that can take in a person's lived life and life expectancy on Earth, and calculate how long they have lived on other planets (and how much longer they have to live on those planets, based on life expectancy)._

_As of Nov. 22nd, 2020, this program is backend only, with no plans to build a functioning UI._

## Specs

# *Conversions*
* _1 Mercury year = 0.24 Earth years_
* _1 Venus year = 0.62 Earth years_
* _1 Mars year = 1.88 Earth years_
* _1 Jupiter year = 11.86 years_

# *User Statements*
* _The user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 2.4 years on Mercury._
* _The user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 6.2 years on Venus._
* _The user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 18.8 years on Mars._
* _The user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 118.6 years on Jupiter._
* _The user should be able to enter their life expectancy on Earth._

* _Assuming a Earth life expectancy (ELE) of 20 years on Earth, the user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 2.4 years left to live on Mercury._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, the user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 6.2 years left to live on Venus._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, the user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 18.8 years left to live on Mars._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, the user should be able to enter 10 years on Earth and return 118.6 years left to live on Jupiter._

* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, and a Earth lived life (ELL) of 30 years, the user should be able to learn that they have lived 2.4 years over the Mercury LE._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, and a lived life (ELL) of 30 years, the user should be able to learn that they have lived 6.2 years over the Venus life expectancy._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, and a lived life (ELL) of 30 years, the user should be able to learn that they have lived 18.8 years over the Mars life expectancy._
* _Assuming a (ELE) of 20 years, and a lived life (ELL) of 30 years, the user should be able to learn that they have lived 118.6 years over the Jupiter life expectancy._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open terminal._
* _Navigate to Desktop._
* _Type "git clone https://github.com/GBProductions/SGSC.git" into command line and press ENTER._
* _Navigate to Space Galactic Age Calcualtor and type "code ." into command line and press ENTER._
* _Type "npm install" into command line and press ENTER._
* _Type "npm run build" into command line and press ENTER._
* _Type "npm run test" into command line and press ENTER._
